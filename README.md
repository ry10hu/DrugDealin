### Make sure you have pip3 installed!

You can check this by running `pip3 --version` in your command line or terminal.

Then install all pip dependencies with `pip3 install -r piprequirements.txt`

# Running the game

For now just bring up your favorite terminal emulator, navigate to the `.py` files, and run `python3 main.py`, or just run it from your file explorer.

We ***may*** ship out packages in the future, but for now that remains unkown.
